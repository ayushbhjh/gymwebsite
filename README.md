# Gym Website

This is a basic HTML file for a gym website. It includes the following sections:

* Home
* Program
* Plan
* Blog
* Contact us
* Footer

The website is styled using a separate CSS file (`gym.css`).

## To run the website:

1. Save the HTML file and the CSS file in the same directory.
2. Open the HTML file in a web browser.

## Note:

* This is a basic example and does not include any functionality such as forms or user authentication.
* You will need to create the `gym.css` file and the `gym.js` file separately.

## I hope this helps
